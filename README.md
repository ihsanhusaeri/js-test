# Asymptotic Analysis Test

## Overview
We will develop a simple program, a "Container Class" which is basically a container to store item of product object for example:
```json
{productId: '01', qty: 1}
```
It will have 3 CRUD method, get, put and delete.

## Prerequisite
a Computer with Node Js installed in it

## Preparation
1. Clone the project
2. Setup the project
```sh
  npm i
  npx jest --watchAll
```
## Tasks
Do these tasks in sequence from the start, don't skip any task to work for the next.

1. Create UNIT Test covering all method of the class
2. Complete the container class implementation until all of your unit test satisfied
3. Analyze complete code, what is the Asymptotic Complexity (Big Oh Notation) of your code ?
    - a. Constant (O(1))
    - b. Linear (O(n))
    - c. Logarithmic (Ο(log n))
    - d. Exponential (2Ο(n))
  
4. If asymptotic performance of your code is not constant, how you can make it constant without major change in your code?
  You can answer with either:
    - a. Show us the code, or
    - b. Tell us how by pseudo code or algorithm

## Answer
3. b. Linear (O(n))
